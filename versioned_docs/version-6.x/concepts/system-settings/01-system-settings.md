## General Settings

### Enable Local Sign Up

This field determines whether users can sign up for an account. If checked, users can sign up for an account. Otherwise,
user accounts will need to be created by an administrator.

### Debug OCR

This field determines whether OCR debugging is enabled. When enabled, OCR timing information will be logged, and the
processed image will be stored in the temp directory for debugging purposes. This is primarily for developers.

### Receipt Processing Settings

This field contains the Receipt Processing Settings used by the app globally. Setting this field allows email
integrations to be used, as well as quick scans, and magic fill.

### Fallback Processing Settings

This field contains the Fallback Processing Settings used by the app globally. These fallback settings are used when the
primary Receipt Processing Settings fail to process a receipt, then the fallback settings are used.

## Task Server Settings

This section configures the task server. After making changes to the task server settings (except for email polling
interval),
the task server must be restarted for changes to take effect. An alert will be shown to remind the user to restart the
task server when necessary. See the [system tasks](/docs/concepts/tasks) documentation for more information.

### Task Concurrency

This field determines how many tasks can be run concurrently. The default value is 10. The types of tasks that can be
run are described in the task queue configuration section.

### Email polling interval in seconds

This field determines how often enabled email integrations are polled for new emails. The default value is 1800 seconds,
or
30 minutes.

### Task Queue Configuration

Each type of task has its own queue, and each queue can be configured. Currently, the only value that can be configured
is the priority of the queue with the higher number being higher priority.

The types of tasks that can be run are:

* Email Polling (Default priority: 2): This queue is responsible for polling email integrations for new emails to
  process.
* Email Receipt Processing (Default priority: 3): This queue is responsible for processing receipts from emails.
* Email Receipt Image Cleanup (Default priority: 1): This queue is responsible for cleaning up images from emails after
  processing. This is
  needed because the images are stored in a temp directory, and the system needs to make sure all processing is complete
  before deleting them.
* Quick Scan (Default priority: 4): This queue is responsible for processing quick scans.

## Currency Settings

This section configures the currency settings in Receipt Wrangler.

### Previews

This shows a quick preview of how the currency will be displayed throughout the app.

### Symbol Display

This field determines what the currency symbol is. By default, this value is "$", it can be changed to any
string, such as "USD", "CAD", "Â£", or even an empty string, etc.

### Symbol Position

- Start, f.ex $ 100.50
- End f.ex 100.50 $

### Thousandths Separator

- , (Comma), f.ex 1,000
- . (Dot) f.ex 1.000

### Decimal Separator
