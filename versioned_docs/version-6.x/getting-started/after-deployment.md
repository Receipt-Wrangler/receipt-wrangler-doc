# After Deployment

## Default User

After the app is deployed, a default user will be created with the following credentials:

```
username: admin
password: admin
```

Visit the manage users screen to set your password. Click on your user avatar to get there.

## Configure AI

Once logged in as the administrator, it is recommended to set up any integrations, such as AI, or email settings.
Take a look at the [AI Concept pages](/concepts/ai.md) and the [Email Concept pages](/concepts/email.md) to get started.
