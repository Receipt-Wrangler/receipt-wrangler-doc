# Email

Email integration is a way for users to upload receipts to a group, as another way to ingest receipts into the system.
Multiple images can be sent in attachements, and each image will be assumed to be a different receipt. If the image is
malformed (corrupted, not actually an image), then the file will not be processed.

## Configuration

1. Configure a System Email in the system settings. Check
   out [the System Settings section](/docs/concepts/system-settings/system-email) to see how to set it up.
2. In the group(s) of interest, navigate to the group settings page, enable the email integration, and select the system
   email to use. Additionally,
   configure
   other fields in the group settings to specify which emails to process. Check
   out [the Group settings section](/docs/concepts/groups/managing-groups#group-settings) for more information.
