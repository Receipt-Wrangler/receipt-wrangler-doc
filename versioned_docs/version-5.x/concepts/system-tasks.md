# System Tasks

System Tasks are records of actions taken by the system, or initiated by a user. Currently, these tasks are not
actionable, nor can normal users see them.

For now, they are primarily used for debugging, and they can help give insight into how a receipt is being processed.

Currently only a few types of entities are associated with system tasks, such as:

* [System Email](/docs/concepts/system-settings/system-email)
* [Receipt Processing Settings](/docs/concepts/system-settings/receipt-processing-settings)

Check out the documentation for these entities, for more information on their associated system tasks.
