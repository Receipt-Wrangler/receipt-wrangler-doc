Google's new policies require new development accounts (such as mine) to run a closed testing period (which is ongoing
now) with a minimum of 20 testers for 14 days. If you are at all interested in Receipt Wrangler, and have an Android
device, I encourage you to join the beta so Receipt Wrangler can get production access as soon as possible.
